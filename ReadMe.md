## Camera

* [hump.camera](http://vrld.github.io/hump/#hump.camera) - A camera utility for LÖVE. A camera can "look" at a position. It can zoom in and out and it can rotate it's view. In the background, this is done by actually moving, scaling and rotating everything in the game world. But don't worry about that.

* [gamera](https://github.com/kikito/gamera) - A camera system for LÖVE


## Helper Libraries

* [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump) - HUMP is a small collection of tools for developing games with LÖVE. (Gamestates, Timer, Vector, Class, Signal, Camera)

* [lume](https://github.com/rxi/lume/) -  collection of functions for Lua, geared towards game development. (Math)

* [knife](https://github.com/airstruck/knife) -  A collection of useful micro-modules for Lua. (Class, State Machines, Bind, Chain, Coroutines, Event, Memoize, Entity, Tests, Timer)


## Input

* [tactile](https://github.com/tesselode/tactile) -  A straightfoward and flexible input library for LÖVE.


## Networking
* [LUBE](https://github.com/bartbes/love-misc-libs/blob/LUBE-1.0/LUBE/docs.md) -  LUBE is a networking library intended to make networking easy for lovers

* [lua-enet](http://leafo.net/lua-enet/) -  lua-enet is a binding to the ENet library for Lua. ENet is a thin network communication layer over UDP that provides high performance and reliable communication that is suitable for games. The interface exposes an asynchronous way of creating clients and servers that is easy to integrate into existing event loops.

* [NoobHub](https://github.com/Overtorment/NoobHub) -  OpenSource multiplayer and network messaging for CoronaSDK, Moai, Gideros & LÖVE

## Object Orientation
* [30log](https://github.com/Yonaba/30log) - a minified framework for object-orientation in Lua. It features named (and unnamed) classes, single inheritance and a basic support for mixins.

* [hump.class](http://vrld.github.io/hump/#hump.class) - A small, fast class/prototype implementation with multiple inheritance. Implements class commons.

* [classic](https://github.com/rxi/classic/) - A tiny class module for Lua. Attempts to stay simple and provide decent performance by avoiding unnecessary over-abstraction.

* [middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass) - A simple OOP library for Lua. It has inheritance, metamethods (operators), class variables and weak mixin support.

## Physics
* [Hardon Collider](http://vrld.github.io/HardonCollider/) - HardonCollider is a Lua module to simplify one important aspect in computer games: Collision detection.

* [Bump](https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua) - A collision detection library for Lua

* [Lope2D](https://bitbucket.org/erlimoen/lope2d-v2/wiki/Home) - Lope2D is a wrap over Love2D physics engine API. It makes dealing with the physics API easier and faster.

## Serialisation

* [Ser](https://github.com/gvx/Ser) - A fast, robust, richly-featured table serialisation library for Lua

* [Lady](https://github.com/gvx/Lady) - Saving and loading LÖVE savegames, based on Ser

* [Smallfolk](https://github.com/gvx/Smallfolk) - A fast, robust, secure, richly-featured table serialisation library for Lua

* [binser](https://github.com/bakpakin/binser) - Customizable Lua Serializer


## Shaders

* [Shadertoy viewer](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=80885) - can run the code copied from shadertoy directly, or you can output the converted code to love shader.

## Tweening

* [AnAL](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=948) - The animations replacement lib

* [tween.lua](https://github.com/kikito/tween.lua) - Tweening/Easing/Interpolating functions for lua. Inspired on jQuery's animate method.

## UI

* [LoveFrames](https://github.com/KennyShields/LoveFrames) - A GUI library for LÖVE

* [GOOi](https://github.com/tavuntu/gooi) - GOOi, an Android-oriented LÖVE GUI

## Utilities

* [love-loader](https://github.com/kikito/love-loader) - Threaded resource loading for LÖVE

* [punchdrunk](https://github.com/TannerRogalsky/punchdrunk) - An attempt to replicate the LÖVE API in the browser using moonshine

## Development

* [Lovebird](https://github.com/rxi/lovebird) - A browser-based debug console for LÖVE

* [lurker](https://github.com/rxi/lurker) - Auto-swaps changed Lua files in a running LÖVE project

* [Lovecat](https://github.com/CoffeeKitty/lovecat) - . Using Lovecat, you can edit your game parameters in a browser, and see the changes in the running game in real time.

* [FPSGraph](https://github.com/icrawler/FPSGraph) - A small FPS graphing utility for LOVE
